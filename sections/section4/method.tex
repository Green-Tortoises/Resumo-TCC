Using the mentioned tools, it will be necessary to construct a modified ACO algorithm to enable its parallel execution on GPUs. The initial algorithm model considered is to calculate ant movements in batches. This allows for the simultaneous treatment of a large set of ants at once. When these ants finish searching for the best path, they return, and all the data is processed. Then, more ants are sent to calculate the new best path, and this process continues until the entire database is processed.

It will be necessary to measure the time it takes for each database to process all the paths. With this data, various graphs will be produced containing the number of instances being processed over time. By analyzing these graphs, it will be possible to identify areas where functions can be optimized to produce better parallel versions.

Finally, the most optimized metrics that could be achieved will be presented. All gains will be measured and documented in this document. The final algorithm obtained will also be presented so that it can be replicated and tested.
