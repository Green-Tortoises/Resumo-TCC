\subsection{Expected Results} \label{ExpectedResults}

It is expected that by the end of this work, an improvement in the ACO algorithm's performance can be identified. Considering that GPUs are optimized for matrix equations, and it is possible to efficiently work with these equations within GPUs, improved performance would allow processing larger databases.

At the end of the work, it is expected that the final database can be executed in considerably less time than its sequential version. The smallest database is not expected to have significant performance gains, as it is already a very reduced database, and its execution happens in just a few seconds even sequentially.

The growth of the ACO algorithm being worked on in this thesis is exponential. By making it parallel, the equation defining its growth will have a slower growth curve, still growing exponentially but being able to process a larger database in the same time as a smaller database executed sequentially. This can be measured using graphs containing the number of instances being processed over time.
