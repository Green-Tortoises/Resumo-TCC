\begin{abstract}
    The ``Instance Selection with Ant Colony Optimization'' algorithm stood out when comparing with other instance selection algorithms
    like the {K-means} or the {Support Vector Machine}. A parallel version is essential for large data sets that
    would take a long time to be processed sequentially. A parallel version of GPU using ROCm is being built
    and significant performance gains are expected in the final version of the algorithm.
